# Counter App

## A React Native mobile app built using Redux.

The first mobile app built on the course, this single page app allows the user to increment or decrement a counter in the range 0 to 10, with each operation added to a history list at the bottom of the screen.

Each history record states the time when the operation occurred, the type of operation (increment/decrement) and the counter value before and after the operation. There is a reset button to reset the value of the counter back to 0.
